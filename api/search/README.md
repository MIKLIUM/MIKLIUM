## Additional Information

### Types of the Information

As you have already noticed, the API returns two types of information: `small` and `large`. How are they different? Information marked `small` is obtained from a brief description of the site from the search engine. And the `large` information is already the full text from the site.

### Choosing the Right Information Format

* You can change the amount of information issued and its type using parameters maxSmallSnippets` (the number of small information for each request (by default 5), `maxLargeSnippets` (the number of large information for each request (by default 2) and `maxLargeSnippetSymbols` (maximum number of characters for one large information (by default 4500).

* By setting the parameter `maxSmallSnippets` to 0, you will receive only information with `large` type, full information from sites. And by setting `maxLargeSnippets` to 0, you will only receive information with `small` type, brief information.

* The number behind the parameters `maxSmallSnippets` and `maxLargeSnippets` is responsible for the amount of relevant information for each request. For example, if we have two quires  in `search`, we set `maxSmallSnippets` to 2, and `maxLargeSnippets` to 1. Thus, 4 small information and 2 large will be found: 2 small and 1 large for each request.

* The parameter `maxLargeSnippetSymbols` is responsible for the maximum number of characters in large information (by default 4500). If the limit is increased, the large information will be cut off.
